# QuickSwizzler

Application for simple image swizzling/channel repacking. 

Set the output for each channel to the desired source channel. 
For instance, to swap the Red and Green channels, set the Red output to G and the Green output to R. 

Pick files to perform swizzle operations on with the Pick File(s) button, clear the list with the Clear File(s) button. 
An output directory must be selected to save the resulting files. 

In order to perform an operation on a selected file, a file must be selected/clicked on within the file list, not just added to it. 

The batch buttons will repack all files inside of the files list and potentially overwrite them!
